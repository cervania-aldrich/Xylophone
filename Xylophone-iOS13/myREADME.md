#  Xylophone 

## Description

This app plays sounds of a Xylophone. 

I created this app as part of the App Brewery's "Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp" course on Udemy. This app was important to make because music apps are popular on the App Store, and this project gave me the opportunity to see how sound is played using AVFoudation and AVAudioPlayer. Additionally, I learned how to explore Stack OverFlow and read the Apple Documentation effectively so that I can solve programming problems on my own, which is a key skill for Software Engineers.

Also, this app was made for learning purposes, hence why the app has documentation comments. I believe this has helped me learn more effectively because it has helped me gain a deeper understanding to why each line of code was written and it helps solidifies the concepts I have learned. Additionally, I feel I have gained an appreciation to the importance of documenting code for collaboration. Furthermore, I believe this resource could be useful for other beginners learning how to develop iOS applications.

## Learning Objectives

What did I learn? How did this app improve my iOS development skills?

There are several concepts that I was able to learn whilst developing this app. This includes:

* How to play sound using the AVFoundation framework and the AVAudioPlayer object.
* Understanding how to refer to the Apple documentation and how to use StackOverflow.
* Learning about functions.
* Creating Swift functions with inputs.
* Function scope.
* Linking multiple elements to one IBAction.
* Playing different sounds for different buttons.
* Error handling in Swift.
* Data Types.
* Code refactoring.
* Basic debugging.
    
## What makes this project stand out?

In addition to the base features of the app that was developed in the course, I added my own touches to further my learning, including:

* Using Vary for Traits so that keys are vertical in landscape mode instead of horizontal.
* Replacing force unwrapping cases with Optionals, Do-Catch Blocks, and the Nil Coalescin Operator. 
* Using internal and external parameter names for more readable function calls.
* Adding comments for more clarity and understanding of the code.
