#  Xylophone 

## Description
This app plays the sounds of a Xylophone. 

I created this app as part of the App Brewery's "Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp'' course on Udemy. 

This app was important to make because music apps are popular on the App Store, and this project gave me the opportunity to see how sound is played using AVFoundation and AVAudioPlayer. Additionally, I learned how to use Stack Overflow and read the Apple Documentation effectively so that I can solve programming problems on my own, a key skill for any Software Engineer.

As this app was made for learning purposes, I have added many comments and documentation markup in order to be as descriptive as possible. It has been an effective learning strategy for me. I found this has helped me understand the Swift language and the Apple Developer documentation better. Also, it helped me not fall into the trap of just copying code from a tutorial, rather I’m reassuring myself that I actually understand the code being written and why it was written. Furthermore, I recognise that documenting code is an important skill to have as a Software Developer, and I believe it is worth practising.

## Instructions
Clone this repository in Xcode to run the project. Run it in the simulator. 

Click the keys to play the Xylophone sounds. 

## Learning Objectives
What did I learn? How did this app improve my iOS development skills?

There are several concepts that I was able to learn whilst developing this app. This includes:

* Figure out how to play sound using AVFoundation framework and AVAudioPlayer object through understanding Apple documentation and Stack Overflow.
* How to use Swift functions and understanding input parameters and return types.
* Function scope.
* Data types.
* Error handling using try and catch.
* Basic debugging for code errors.
* Linking multiple elements to one IBAction.
* Play different sounds for different buttons.
* Code refactoring.
    
## What makes this project stand out?
In addition to the base features that was developed in the course, I innovated on top of the app to further my learning, such as:

* Add comments to help explain my code.
* Use the DocC framework to add Swift documentation to guide end-users reviewing the code, but to also help myself understand coding concepts better.
* Use ‘Vary for Traits’ so that keys are vertical in landscape mode instead of horizontal, for better UX.
* Replace force unwrapping cases with Optionals, Do-Catch Blocks, and the Nil Coalescing Operator.
* Use internal and external parameter names for more readable function calls.
